# Knife::PartialSearch

Uses chef server partial search api to improve usual knife commands.

Note: partial search api is available directly in (https://docs.chef.io/release_notes.html#filter-search-results)[chef 12].
This gem should at some point become deprecated as knife internally uses this api.
